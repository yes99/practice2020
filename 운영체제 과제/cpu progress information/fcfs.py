# **Implement the First Come First Serve (FCFS) non preemptive algorithm by taking user
# input of the arrival & burst time of different processes.**

# In[ ]:

import numpy as np


# **Taking user input in this step. Users need to enter all the value for **AT** and **BT** spear with spaces. Input must be a set of even numbers.**

# In[ ]:

# **This step checking that user input **even number** of values. And showing the inputs.**

# **In this step whole user 1D input is converted into a 2D array, Also showing the 2D output where each column represents a process. Where first element is **Arrival time** AT **and the Second element is Burst time **BT ** **

# **This step is sorting the processes by their Arrival time** AT

# **This step is calculating the completion time **CT**, We know that *Completion Time is the Time at which process completes its execution*. ** Also showning Completion Time for each process.

# **This step is calculating the Turn Around Time **TAT**, We know that *Turn Around Time is the Time Difference between completion time and arrival time.**  Also showning Completion Time for each process.
